Benefits and Considerations of Using Cloud Services
High Availability
	1.An agreed level of operational performance
	2.Hospitals and data centers require high avalability
	3.Downtime referes to periods when a system is unavailable
Load Balancers in Azure
	1.scale your applications and create high availability for services
	2.support inbound and outbound scenarios
	3.provides low latency and high throughput
	4.Scales up to millons of flows for all tcp and udp applications
Scalability
	1.App/Infrastructure can expand to meet needs
	Four General areas that scalability can apply to
		a.Disk I/O
		b.CPU
		c.Memory
		d.Network I/O
	Two main ways of scaling
		Horizontal
		Vertical
Vertical Scaling
	1.Considered the easier of the two methods
	2.adds more power to an existing instance
	3.can mean more memory,faster storage,or more pwoerful cpu
	4.Considered easier because hardware upgrades are easy
	  on cloud platforms
	5.very little added configuration required to scale up
Horizontal Scaling
	1.More complex than vertical scaling
	2.Add more servers to spread the load across multiple
	  machines
	3.More servers mean more general administration tasks
	4.must sync application,data,and bacups across multiple
	  instances
Vertical vs Horizontal scaling
	1.Horizontal scaling is often considered a long term advantage
	2.Vertical scaling is usually considered a short advantage
Virtual machine scale set in Azure
	1.Create And Manage groups of identical,load balanced VMs
	2.Number of Vm instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand 
	  or a defined schedule
	3.Provide High availabilit to applications
	4.Allow you to centrally manage,configure,and update a large number
  	  of vms
	5.Build large-scale services for areas such as compute,bigdata,and container
	  workloads
Elasticity
	1.Handles high volumes of traffic
	2.Covers ability to scale up and down
	3.Use less resources when needed
	4.Keeps users happy
	5.Saves money
	6.Avoids over-provisioning
	7.Avoids under-provisionning
AutoScaling in Azure
	1.Have the right amount of resources running to handle the load
	  on your application
	2.Add resources to handle increases in load
	3.Removes resources that are sitting idle
	4.Speify a minimum and maximum number of instances to run
	5.Add or remove vms automatically based on a set of rules
	6.When rule conditions are met,autoscale actions are triggered
Agility
	1.value=Agility+Utilization
	2.The ability to provision and de-provision nearly unlimited	
	3.Resources as n.eeded with complete control
	4.Singniicant cost advantages and even greater value in the ability
	  to quickly solve business problems
	5.Business can move fast when they need to
	6.Projects can be conceived,provisione,and deployed within
	  24 hours
	7.Cloud allows real-time planning and execution
Fault tolerance
	1.The same(conceptually)as in private or hosted enviornments
	2.Ability to continue providing service to underlying applications
	  even after the failure of one or more components
Availability sets in Azure
	1.A logical grouping capability
	2.Distributes vm availability across multiple physical servers,
	 compute racks,storage units,and network switches
	3.If a hardware or azure software failure occurs,only a subset of 
	  your vms are impacted
	4.Essential to building reliable cloud solutions
Disaster recovery
	1.focuses on recovering from a catastrophic loss of
	  application functionality
	2.Business must determine how much functionality is required during a
   	  disaster
	Disaster recover types
		a.Completely unavailable
		b.partially available
		c.fully available
Azure site recovery service
	1.ensure continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running
	  during outages
	2.Replicates workloads on physical and virtual machines(VMs) from
	  a primary site to a secondary location
	3.when an outage occurs at primary site,fail over to secondary location
	4.After the primary location is running again,fail back to it
CAPEX VS OPEX
CAPEX
	1.Money a company spends towards fixed assests sometimes knows as
	  PP&E -Property,Plant,OR Equipment one-time purchases
OpEx
	1.Funds used to Run Day-to-Day Business
	2.Generally used up within the year they are purchased
	3.Includes consumables such as printer cartridges,paper,and electricity
	4.items such as yearly service or maintaince agreements,web site hosting
	  and web domain registrations
Infrastructure as a service
	1.Instant computing infrastructure
	2.Provisioned and managed over the internet
	3.Scale up and down with demand
	4.Pay only for what resources you use
Common IAAS Scenarios
	1.Test and Development
	2.website hosting
	3.Storage,backup,and recovery
	4.Web apps
	5.High-performance computing
	6.Big data analysis
	Advantages
		a.Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost
		b.improve business continuity and disaster recovery
		c.Innovate rapidly
		d.respond quicker to shifting business conditions
		e.focus on your core business
		f.increase stability,reliability and supportability better 
		  security
		g.Gets new apps to user faster
	When to Use IaaS
		1.you are a startup or a small company
		2.Large organization looking to only purchase what is 
		  actually consumed or needed
		3.Rapidly growing companies

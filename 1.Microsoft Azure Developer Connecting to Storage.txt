Network Security
	connection Types
		Public Endpoint
			-internet facing
			-Service Endpoint-Virtual Network(VNET)Facing
			-Internal VNET Endpoint-Resource is inside the VNET
	proper firewall setting are critical for public endpoint services
	Different service Names
		https://****.core.windows.net
		TCP:***database.windows.net,port 1433
		TCP:***.redis.cache.widnows.net,port 6380
	Authentication and Authorization
Connecting to Azure Storage
	1.Highly available,secure,durable,scalable,and redundant
	inlcudes these services
		a.Tables
		b.Queues
		c.Files
		d.Blobs
	service names
		a.https://****.table.core.windows.net		
		b.https://****.queue.core.windows.net
		c.https://****.file.core.windows.net
		d.https://****.table.blob.windows.net
	Network Security Options
		Public Endpoint
	Authorizing Access
		1.Azure Active Directory(AAD)
			a.Role-based access control
			b.Users,Groups or Applications
			c.High security with ease of use
		2.Shared Keys
			a.Root password of the storage account
			b.There are alwasy 2 active keys
			c.No identity authentication
			d.Shared Keys should not be used unless absolutely 
			  necessary
		3.Shared Access Signature(SAS) Token
			a.Does not authenticate an identity
			b.Granular control over the access granted
			c.Configurable parameters
			d.Can be revoked
		4.Anonymous Access
			a.Anonymous access is read-only
			b.Network security is still verified
			c.No identity or authorization check
	Azure AD should be used over SAS tokens whenever possible
	Demo
		azure storage explorer
Connecting to Azure Databases
	Offerings
		a.Azure SQL Database(single database and elastic pools)
		b.Azure SQL Managed Instance
	Service Name
		a.Protocol:TCP
		b.Port:1433
		c.Server name:****.database.windows.net
		d.Database name
	Network Security Options
		a.Proper firewall configuration is critical,especially
		  for public endpoint databases
	Authentication and Authorization
		a.Azure AD should be used over SQL Authentication
		  whenever possible
		b.SQL Database closes connections that remain idle
		  for more than 30 minutes
	Available Permissions
		1.Server
		2.Database
		3.Object(tables,views,stored procedures)
	Sql Database Built-in Server roles
		1.Administrator
		2.Login Manager
		3.Database Creator
Connecting to Azure Databases - Summary
	1.The services include public,VNET service endpoints and VNET placement
	2.Authentication and authorization can be done through AAD or SQL
	  Authentication
	3.Lots of options in terms of controlling permissions
	4.Put it all together to connect SSMS to Azure SQL Database
Connecting to Redis Cache
	Redis Cache
		A high-throughput,low-latency,secure managed service of this
		open-source of this open-source in-memory cache
	Tiers
		Basic,Standard,Premium
	Service Name
		Protocol:TCP
		Port:6379 or 6380 (SSL)
		Server name:*****.redis.cache.windows.net
	As a security best practice,do not enable non-SSL port connections
	Authentication and Authorization
		Store Shared Keys securely as they provide full access to your cache
	Secure Connection with Redis CLI
		Tools
			Redis CLI
			stunnel
Connecting to Redis Cache-summary
	1.The service includes public endpoint or VNET placement
	2.Access authorization is done through Shared Keys
	3.Redis CLI is a popular utility to interact with a Redis cache
	4.Put it all together to connect Redis CLI to Azure Redis Cache

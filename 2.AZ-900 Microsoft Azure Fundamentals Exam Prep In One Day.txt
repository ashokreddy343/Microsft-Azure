Understanding Cloud concepts
High Availability
	1.Expressed as a percentage it's the availability of a system to respond
	  to users
	2.99.99% 
Scalability
	1.The ability of a system to handle growth of users or work
Elasticity
	1.The ability of a system to automatically grow and shringk based on 
	  application demand
Agility
	1.The ability to change based on changes to market
	  or envirnment
Fault Tolerance
	1.The ability of system to handle faults like power,
	  networking,or hardware failures
Disaster Recovery
	1.The ability of a system to recover from failure within a
	  period of time,and how much data is lost
Economies of Scale
	1.It's cheaper for Microsoft to run a server than you can
	  ever achieve yourself
Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx)
	1.CapEx is money invested in assets(like computers) that
	  return investment over time
	2.OpEx is money spent every day on operating expenses
Consumption-Based Model
	Pay per minute
	Pay per hour
	Pay per execution
Paradigms for hosting applications -IaaS,PaaS,SaaS
Infrastructure-as-a- Service(IaaS)
	Virtual machines,networking,load balancers,firewalls  
Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS)
	1.Upload code packages and have them run,without access to the
	  hardware
Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)
	Access to configuration only
Public,private and hybrid clouds
public cloud
	1.computing services offered over the public internet
	  anyone can sign up
Private cloud
	1.Computing services offered to only select useres;internal or 
   	  corporate cloud
Hybrid cloud
	1.Combination of public and private clouds;scale private infrastructure to
	 the cloud
Cloud Concepts Quiz
1.Financially speaking, one of the benefits of using cloud computing over hosting applications yourself on 	  servers you own is..								
	ans.the tax and cash flow benefits of using Operational Expenditure(OpEX) instead of 
	 	    Capital Expenditure(CapEX)
2.What is the principle of Economies of Scale?	
	The more of something you buy,the cheaper it is own and operate per unit
3.How many minutes per month of downtime is 99.99% availability?
	-4 minutes
	-99.99% equates to 4 minutes per month
4.When using the term "public cloud", what is it that makes it public versus private?
	-anyone with a credit card can sign up for public cloud computing.
	 there is generally no restriction on who can be a customer
	-yes,public cloud is available for all
5.Which cloud computing model does a virtual machine fall into?
	-Infrastructure as a service

Core Azure Servies Quiz
1.Azure claims there are 54 regions. But when I create my account, 
  I can only see 30 or so. What happened to the other regions?	
	ans:Azure Government,Azure Germany and Azure China require separate
	    accounts to access
2.Which of Azure's architectural components allows you to specify exactly 
  which data center in a region a virtual machine resides?				
	ans:Availability Zones
3.Which of the following Azure services is NOT part of the compute services?
	Virtual Networks
4.What is the function of a load balancer?
	ans:it diverts traffic between  two or more servers to evenly distribute the load among
	    several servers.it allows you to add additional servers to increase
	    capacity without downtime
5.Where do you find virtual machine images provided by third party companies within the Azure Portal?
	In the Azure Marketplace

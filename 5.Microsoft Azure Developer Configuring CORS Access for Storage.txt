CORS Concepts
	All CORS requests must include origin header
Common CORS Headers
	Request
		Origin
		Access-Control-Rquest-Method
		Access-Control-Request-Headers
	Response
		Access-Control-Allow-Origin			
		Access-Control-Allow-Methods
		Access-Control-Allow-Headers
		Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
		Access-Control-Max-Age
CORS in the browser
	Enable CORS using crossorigin
		<img crossorigin src=""/>
	Triggering Pereflighted Requests
		a.Applied to outgoing requests that contain custom headers,
		  non-simple content types,or methods like PUT,PATCH and DELETE
		b.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
	CORS is not an authentication mechanism
Using CORS with Azure Storage
	1.Multiple origin support
	2.Separate rules per service
	3.Partial matching with headers
	4.Set allowed max age,headers and methods
CORS Limitions in Azure Storage
	1.No premium storage support
	2.5 rules per service
	3.Max of 2 KB
	4.256 character limitation on header and origin names
	5.Max of 64 literal headers
	6.Max of 2 partial headers
Configuring Azure Storage CORS Rules
	CORS Rules concepts
		Allowed Origins
			can be list of comma-separated origin hostnames
			Can be a single * wildcard value
			Must be exact case-sensitive match
			<AlloedOrigins>
				https://contoso.com,https://visitcontoso.com
			</allowedorigins>
		Allowed Methods
			a.The allowed HTTP request verbs(methods)
			b.Comma-separated
			c.Can be any of :DELETE,GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS AND PUT
		Allowed Headers
			1.Comma-sepearated literal or wildcard-prefixed header names
			2.Can also be single wildcard(*) value to allow any
		ExposedHeaders
			<ExposedHeaders>
				x-ms-meta-*,x-request-duration
			</ExposeHeaders>
			1.Sent in the Access-Control-Expose-Headers response header
			2.Comma-sepearate list of literal or widlcard-prefixed header names
		Max Age in Seconds
			<MaxAgeInSeconds>180</MaxAgeInSeconds>
			1.Amount of time browser should cache the preflight OPTIONS request
			2.Sent in the Acccess-Control-Max-Age response header
			3.Reduces amount of billed preflight requests
Evalution Logic
	1.Azure will stop evaluating rules after a successful
	  origin + method match
	2.List rules in most restrictive to least restritive
	  order
Vary Header logic
CORS with Storage Services
Configuring CORS Using the AzureRM powershell SDK
	Login-AzAccount
	Set-AzContext -Sub
	Get-Help *Az*Storage*
Configuring CORS Using Azure CLI
	az login
	az account set
	az storage cors list --help
	az storage cors clear --services b
Configuring CORS using the azure storage service rest api
	1.Using postman with Azure REST APIs
	2.Setting rules on storage services
	2.Testing rules
Special Considerations for ARM Templates
	1.Some Azure Storage properties including CORS rules
	  cannot be set in Azure ARM templates
	ARM Templates with Storage SDKs
		1.Create an ARM template for Storage accounts
		2.Deploy ARM template
		3.Run storage SDK commands against newly Created account
Wrap up and What's Next
	1.CORS rule evaluation has nuances that are important to be 
	  aware of
	2.Corss-platform azure tooling for developers and operations
	3.CORS requests can be evaluated using Postman
	4.ARM templates do not yet support some storage service properties

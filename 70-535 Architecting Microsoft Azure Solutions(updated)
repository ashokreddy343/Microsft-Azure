Virtual Machines
Introduction to virtual machines
Availability Sets
	Availability :What percentage of the time will your application be accessiable ?
	Fault Domains 
		unexpected hardware failure
	Update Domains
		planned updates to Azure
Web Apps containers
	5 ways we can run applications
	1.Virtual Machines
		Customapp + dependencies installed separately
	2.App Services
		Give your code to Azure to run
	3.Web Apps for containers
		Custom app+Dependencies packaged together
		Fully Managed 
		AutoScaling
		Easy Continuous Integration /Continuous Deployment
			a)Docker Hub
			b)GitHub
			c)Azure Container Registry
	4.Serverless
	5.Microservices
Virtual Machine Scale Sets(VMSS)
	1.Create Virtual machine took us 8 minutes
	2.How do you create 100 identical virtual machines?
	3.And How do you scale up and down those virtual machines to add
	  more or reduce the number?
	4.VMSS	
		a)Create and Manage a group of identical,load balanced VMs
		b)you can define a schedule for them to scale
		c)Or have it triggered based on demand
 	5.VMSS Limitations
		a)Up to 1000 VM instances if you use a marketplace image
		b)Up to 300 VM instances if you want to provide your own vm image
	6.Difference between VM and VMSS
		a)Manually create additional VMs as reuired
		b)Manually create load balancer or application gateway
		c)Manually create availability set and use availability zones
		d)Manually monitor performance and execute steps for scaling

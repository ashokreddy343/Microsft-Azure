Encrypt a VM
	1.Create a KeyVault
		create a key
	2.Both keyvault and vm location should be same
 $KVRGname = 'MyKeyVaultResourceGroup';
 $VMRGName = 'MyVirtualMachineResourceGroup';
 $vmName = 'MySecureVM';
 $KeyVaultName = 'MySecureVault';
 $KeyVault = Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName $KeyVaultName -ResourceGroupName $KVRGname;
 $diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl = $KeyVault.VaultUri;
 $KeyVaultResourceId = $KeyVault.ResourceId;

Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension -ResourceGroupName $VMRGname -VMName $vmName -DiskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl $diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl -DiskEncryptionKeyVaultId $KeyVaultResourceId;

Azure Virtual Machine Quiz
	What is a Virtual Machine?
		1.A service that cloud providers offer that falls under the category of IaaS.
		2.it is a portion of machine that is running in an azure data center that you
		  can control

		  Desired State Configuration. 
	 	3.This lets you control how your environment looks and prevents 
		  developers or ops from changing it accidentally.
Which of the following is a prerequisite for encrypting the operating system disk of a virtual machine?
	1.you must have an encryption key inside an Azure key vault
If you are unable to connect from your computer to a Windows VM by RDP, what is the first thing you should check?
	1.Check to see if port 3389 is open on the network security group
 
What is the default VM size that Azure wants to use when you create a VM?
	Standard DS1

Azure Functions=Events+Code
Azure Functions
	1.Part of App Service
		-Now in version 2
	2.Simplified programming model
		-Just the code to respond to the event
		-Eliminate bolierplate
		-Focus on the business requirements
	3.Consumption-based pricing model
		-pay as you go
		-only pay for what you use
		-Automatic scale
Azure functions pricing
	Run in an App service plan
		-you can use existinv pricing models
	or you can use the consumption plan
Consumption Plan
	Billing Model
		-Number of executions
		-CPU time(s) * RAM(GB)
	Free monthly grant
		-1,000,000 executions
		-4000,000 GB-s
Cutting costs
	1.Reduce your costs
		-Faster invocation times
		-Fewer invocations
		-Reduced memory requirements
	2.Consumption plan
		-Limited to five minutes per execution
		-Optional daily quota
Alternative Pricing Options
	Regular App service plan
		-Pay for dedicated servers
		-Predictable monthly cost
		-Serveral pricing tiers
		-No function duration constraints
	Azure function premium plan
Azure Function Benefits
	1.Rapid and simple development
		-Code within the Azure portal
		-Eliminate boilperplate
	2.All the power of azure web apps
		-CI,Kudu,Easy Auth,Certificates,custom domains
		-Settings etc
	3.Cost-effective pricing
		-Pay for what you use
	4.No servers to maintain
		Automatic scaling
What is Serverless?
	1.there are still servers(of course)
		-you delegate the management of them
	2.Use Platform as a service wherever possible
		eg. Cosmos DB,Atho0
	3.Run your custom code on Azure Functions
		-Respond to events
		-Function as a Service(FaaS)
A Real-world Example
Azure Function Use Cases
	1.Experiments and prototyping
	2.Automating development processes
	3.Decomposing or extending monolithic applications
	4.Independent scaling
	5.Adapters for integrating systems
	6.Go serverless

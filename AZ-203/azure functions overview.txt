1.Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of 
  code, or "functions," in the cloud. 
2.Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure
Features
	1.Choice of language
	2.Pay-per-use-pricing model
	3.Bring your own dependencies
	4.Integrated security
		a.Protect HTTP-triggered functions with OAuth providers 
	 	  such as Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Twitter, 
		  and Microsoft Account.
	5.Simplified integration
	6.Flexible development
What can i do with functions?
	1.It is a great for processing data,integrating systems,working with the IOT
	  and building simple APIs and microservices
Function provides different types of templates
	1.HTTPTrigger
	2.TimeTrigger
	3.CosmosDBTrigger
	4.BlobTrigger
	5.QueueTrigger
	6.EventGridTrigger
	7.EventHubTrigger	
	8.ServiceBusQueueTrigger 
	9.ServiceBusTopicTrigger
Integrations 
	1.Azure Functions integrates with various Azure and 3rd-party services.
The following service integrations are supported by Azure Functions:
	1.Azure Cosmos DB
	2.Azure Event HUB
	3.Azure Event Grid
	4.Azure Notification Hubs
	5.Azure Service Bus(queues and topics)
	6.Azuure Storage(blob,queues,and tables)
	7.On-premises(using service bus)
	8.Twilio(SMS messages)
How much does Function cost ?
	Azure Functions has two kinds of pricing plans.
	1.Consumption plan
		a.When your function runs, Azure provides all of the 
		  necessary computational resources. 
		b.You don't have to worry about resource management, 
		   and you only pay for the time that your code runs.
	2.App Service plan
		a.Run your functions just like your web apps
		b.When you are already using App Service for your other applications,
		  you can run your functions on the same plan at no additional cost.

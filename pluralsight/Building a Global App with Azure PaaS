Traffic Manager profile
	1.Azure Traffic Manager helps reduce downtime and improve responsiveness of
	  important applications by routing incoming traffic across multiple deployments in different 	  regions
	2.Built-in health checks and automatic re-routing help ensure high availability 
	  if a service fails
	3.Use Traffic Manager with Azure services including Web Apps, 
	  Cloud Services and Virtual Machines - or combine it with on-premises 
	  services for hybrid deployments and smooth cloud migration.
	Use Traffice Manager
		a.improve app availability with automatic failover
		b.Increase your app's responsiveness by routing end users to
		  the Azure location with lowest network latency.
		c.Seamlessly combine on-premises and cloud.

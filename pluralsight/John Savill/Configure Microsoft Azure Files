Why this is important
	1.Azure files provides a flexible,easy to use SMB-compatible storage solution
	  and with azure files sync becomes a core part of the organizations file storage
	  strategy
SMB Overview
	1.File-base protocol that can be mounted by Windows,Linux and
	  Mac OS
	2.Get-SmbConnection | f1 *
Azure Storage Overview
	1.One of the foundational services in Azure
	2.Utilized through the creation of a storage account
	3.A storage account has various properties
		-Account kind
		-Location
		-Replication
		-Performance
		-Secure transfer requirement
		-Virtual network configuration
	Different storage services are supported:Blob,Queue
	Table and Files
Azure Storage Replication
	Locally-redundant storage(LRS)
		region
			AZ1,AZ2,AZ3(same data center)
	Zone-redundant storage(ZRS)
	Geo-redundant storage(GRS)
	Read-access geo-redundant storage(RA-GRS)
Azure Storage Encryption
	1.By default storage accounts are transparently encrypted
	  at rest using a 256-bit AES encryption,Storage service Encryption(SSE)
	2.This cannot be disabled and has no performance impact
	3.This applies to blobs,tables,queues and files
	4.For blobs and files customer-managed keys can be used through
	  integration with Azure key vault
	Secure Transfer
		1.Encrypted connections to storage is optional
Firewall and Virtual Network Integration
	1.By default the various endpoints of the storage account are accessible to
	  any client with the required keys
	2.Specific ranges of IP addresses can be granted access
	3.Virtual Network Integration enables access only from specific
	  subnets of virtual networks within the same and paired region as
	  storage account
	
Why Use Azure FIles ?
	1.Azure Files provides an Azure Storage based on SMB solution
	2.SMB 2.1 and 3 supported in addition for File REST protocol
	3.Benefits from Azure hosting
		-SLA -99.9%
		-Availability - Worldwide footprint of regions 
		-Redundancy
		-Disaster recovery
Creating an Azure File Share
	1.Multiple Azure Files shares can be created under a 
	  storage account
	2.Each has a name and optional quota assigned
Accessing Azure Files
	1.Access is via standard SMB client
	2.rest access can utilize shared access signatures(SAS)
	Shared Access Signature Usage
		a.when using SAS access to specific shares and files
		  can be granted
		b.SAS tokens based on polcies
		c.Tokens can limit rights and the duration of access
		d.The SAS token is used when establishing the storage context
Azure Active Directory Authentication
	1.Azure Files utilize Azure AD for authentication via Azure
	  AD Domain Services
	Azure AD Authentication Requirements
		a.Azure AD Domain Services must be deployed to the virtual network
		b.Usage must be from a machine joined to the AAD DS instance
		c.ACLs must be copied to Azure files via Robocopy
		d.The Azure Files share must NOT be part of an Azure Files Sync 
		  sync group
		e.A drive must be mapped to the Azure Files share
Azure AD Domain Services 101
Azure Files Scale and Limits
	1.500 TB storage account
	2.5 TB File Share
	3.1 TB MAx file size
	4.1000 IOPS peer share
	5.60 MBps throughput
	6.99.9% read access to data SLA

How does it work?
	1.first you are going to crate service in azure portal
	2.set up an index that your application can query to return 
	  search results to end results.	
	3.It works on a push-pull mechanism.So you can push information 
	  into the index or you can pull it.
	4.you have got native support for pulling information from 
	  Cosmos DB, SQL Server Database, Azure SQL Database or even data 
	  that is stored in Azure Storage, particularly data in table storage
	5.Eventually everything is going to be JSON documents in the 
	  index so you just have to be able to push the data into that.
	6.There are command line tools and APIs and SDKs that help you to do that

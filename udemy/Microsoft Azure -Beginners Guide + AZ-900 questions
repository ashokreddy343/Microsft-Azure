What is cloud computing?
	1.cloud computing is the delivery of computing
	  services-servers,storage,database,networking,
	  software,analytics,intelligence and more -over the
	  the internet(the cloud) to offer faster innovation,flexible
	  resources and ecnomices of scale.
	2.you typically pay only for cloud services you use,
	  helping lower your operating costs,rung your
	  infrastructure more efficently
Cloud Computing
	1.Don't need to manage data centers
	2.Don't need to buy physical hardware upfront
	3.Create resources on demand on the cloud
	4.Only pay for how much you use
What is Azure ?
	CLoud Computing service
	Built by microsoft
	Build,Deploy and Manage applications
	Used by developers and IT Professionals
Resources and Resource Groups
	what is a resource
		an item define in Azure
		Virtual machine
		A virtual network
		A SQL Database
	Resource Group
		1.Logical placing for your resources
		2.Manage your resources collectively
		3.Easier to maintain
		4.Role Based access
		5.All of the resources are deployed via the Resource Manager
Resource Location
	1.Different data centers located around the world
	2.Create a resource(Virtual Machine) in West Eurpoe,Central US>
	3.You would ideally create a resource in a region that is 
	  closest to your users
	4.see Micrsoft documentation for Azure Regions
	  Products available by particular region
Introductory Quiz
	1.What is the container which is used in Azure to host resources
		Resource Groups
			All resources need to be placed in a group called a resource group
Azure Virtual Machines
	There is a lot more
		Virtual Network
			VM
			Disk
			IP
			NIC(Network Interface Card)
	Settings for the virtual Machine
		1.Name of the machine
		2.The disk type			
		3.Login user name and password
		4.Subscription
		5.Resource Group
		6.Location for your resource
		7.Size of your machine(CPU,Memory,Disk size support,
		  Additional features)-this affects the pricing
		8.Storage for the Virtual Machine
		9.Virtual network
		10.Subnet
		11.IP address
		12.Network Security Group Rules
	Installing IIS on the VM
Azure Virtual Machine Types
	1.General Purpose
	2.Compute Optimized
	3.Memory Optimized
	4.Storage Optimized
	5.GPU
	6.High performance Compute
Azure Virtual Machine Reserved Instances
	1.Option to pay upfront
	2.Make a commitment of 1 year or 3 years
	3.Decide on the region,machine type
	4.Potential to save on costs by 72% from pay as you go
Virtual Machine Series
Costing for Azure resources
	1.pricing depends on the resource you choose
	2.you should always check how the pricing works for a particular
	  resource
	3.virtual machines
		-Depends on the size of the VM
		-Bigger capacity for CPU Memory -additional costs
		-Depends on the region
		-Depends on the type of Operating System
		-Rember you also get charged for the underlying Operating System Disk
	4.There is a pricing calculator which can be used to give an estimate of the costs
	5.There is also a cost management feature available for azure
	6.Look for caveats in costing
	7.For virtual machines
		-if you shutdown from the os,you will get charged
		-To not get further charged,shutdown the os from the portal or powershell.
		 here  the machine will get deallocated
	Cost Management + Billing - Billing accounts provided by azure
State of the Virtual Machine
	VM
	   1.OS Disk -127 GB
	   2.Temporary Disk - 4GB
	      Do not stroe important data on the Temporary Volume
	How can you stop and start a virtual machine
		1.you can go to the OS and shutdown the virtual machine
		2.You can also go to the portal and shutdown the VM
	1.if you have a web application that needs to have an IP that does not change
	  consider using a static IP
	2.if you want to store application data on separate volume apart from the OS
	  level disk,consider attaching data disks
	3.Each data disk can be of maximum size of 4 TB
